Question 1
Write some code that generates an m x n multiplication table.

For example if m=3 and n=4 your output should look something like:

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
---------------
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
---------------
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
---------------
Your code should be generic enough that it can handle any positive integer values of m and n.
